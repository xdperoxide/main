					<h2>Location & Time</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Hang Seng cash deposit machine Mongkok MTR station, near D exit, 17:30-18:30 9 Oct</li>
						<li>HSBC Lam Tin Express Banking (Shop No. H, Level 4, Sceneway Plaza, 8 Sceneway Road, Lam Tin, Kowloon), 15:00 - 16:00 11 Oct
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p><strong>Location 1:</strong> About 20 people were waiting at the queue. Most of them were young adult (20~30). Each person used less than 3 minutes to complete the opertion. Only 3 people reinserted the notes again after the machine rejected the notes. Those who got rejected as much time as other successful case. Most of them do not print recipt when they finish.</p>
					<p>(The place was too crowded to take photo)</p>
					<p><strong>Location 2:</strong> Only 10 people used the machine during that period. There were more careful users than the user group in location as most of them check their account balance after depositing the money. They took an average of 5 minutes to complete the operation. </p>

					<h2>Frequency & time taken to complete the operation</h2>
					<p>Deposition machine facilitates users to deposit banknotes efficiently as it saves waiting time at the counter service. The machine accepts at most 100 100/500/1000 notes at one time. In case users deposit a large amount of cash, they can put several stacks of notes until they end the operation. Total time needed should be less than 5 minutes. However, it is less common for user to deposit money with the deposit machine than online transaction as online banking is more convenient and more secure.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>The waiting queue</h2>
					<p>Usually have to wait until last person finish. People in the queue were talking/texting on the phone or chatting with their friends. Some of them searching for their purse. Some were holding their purse waiting patiently so that they can get their cards immediately when they reach the machine.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>Special observation</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>One user counts the number of notes before putting to the entrance. After she finished the operation, she verified the money saved in the atm machine next to it. In fact, the deposit can check the account balance after they complete their deposition.</li>
						<li>A middle aged woman takes the screenshot after each step with her phones. She entered the bank account no slowly and looked at her phones alongside. She was an experienced who contacting someone she knowed to help her complete the process. Some people also talked on the phone from waiting to deposit their money.</li>
						<li>A middle aged man just asked someone next to him at the queue to help him. He seemed to be a first time user but refuse to follow the given isntruction. He was told steps to go through and finally completed the operations.</li>
						<li>A few people stretched the stack of banknote slightly, assuming that the operation will be smoother. Those who got their notes rejected also stretched the note before reinserting it to the machine.</li>
						<li>A man tried to deposit $20 notes and the machine rejected in location 1 (Only a few HSBC machines accpets $20/50 notes currently, including the one at location 2). He failed for a few times then just turned away.</li>
						<li>A teenager failed to deposit his money for several times even if he reinesrted his cards again. No one was nearby to help him. After 10 mintes, he called his parents that he completed the task and told them he put the money in the wrong direction for a few times.</li>
						<li>One user used both hands to put the notes to the machines, while the rest of them use one hand even if it is a large stack of notes. This user have difficulties in inserting the banknotes for a few times already. </li>
						<li>There were recipts on the ground come from the deposit machine. The recipt has their bank account and amount deposit printed on it, probably by some careless users.</li>
					</ol>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>The most difficult task to go through - Insert the banknotes</h2>
						<p>Reason:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Not all bank note are even in shape. Folded or slightly damaged notes affect the machine detection. Old/frequently used notes can be more difficult to be accepted as they are more uneven in shape. User may have to try a few more time to deposit all of the notes.
							</li>
							<li>
								User may not realize notes that cannot be accepted by the machine. They may also mix paper clips or staple on the note as well.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<strong>Response upon failure</strong>
						<p>
							Users will retry until they deposit all the banknote. User stretch the notes, unfolded the dog-ears etc. when the note is rejected. Some of them reinsert the card again to see if it can success when the machine rejects notes for a several times.
						</p>	
						</div>
						<div>
							<strong>Other concern on invalid input</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>The machine should prevent unknown object stucking at the bank note entrance as it will not work anymore.</li>
								<li>A larger gap at the banknote entrance facilitates depositing a large stack of banknote, but it is also easier for unknown objects entering the entrance.</li>
							</ul>

						<h2>Task Analysis with Personas</h2>
						<h3>Scenario #1</h3>
							<p>
							It is now 3:50pm. A long queue at the counter. An office admin would like to deposit 75,000 with a mixture of 100&500 bank note for the company she worked. She also has to deliver a doucment to client office before 5pm. She had to deposit the cash quickly. <br> Steps she goes through:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Insert the bank card. </li>
								<li><p>She inserts 1/4 notes into the machine. Each stack is mixing with 100 & 500 notes.</p>
								<p><strong>Task Analysis</strong> This is a typical usage of the machine. Hurry user intends to save waiting and operation time by using the machine. <br>She splits the bank notes in 4 stacks bacause the machine accepts at most 100 notes at one time only.</p></li>
								<li><p>The machine successfully takes all the notes in each insertion. She put her hand in front of the card entrance to wait for the card. She grabs the card and recpit and ran away quickly from the machine.</p>
								<p><strong>Task Analysis</strong> The step also proves the she is experienced user because she expected the card and recipt to come out.</p></li>
							</ol>
							<div>
								<strong>Improvement for the machine</strong>
								<p>Show the number of notes and the sum accepted on the recipt. User may not remember how many notes they deposit. In case of failure, it is easier for the bank officers to verify the amount of notes accepted by the machine.
									<p>Hurry user is disatified by slow processing time (long time to calculate the deposit amount/number of deposit banknotes). The machine should calculate the amount of notes deposit regardless of quantity.</p>
								</div>
							</section>

					<h3>Scenario #2</h3>
					<p>An old lady wants to save money to her account. She has not used any kind of ATM service before. She can only read numbers but not words. She is also poor at caclualation and remembering number. She came to the bank just after the bank office hour.<br> Steps she goes through:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>She put the card to recipt exit then the card entrance in wrong direction. She turned the card until the machine accepted the card.
						<p><strong>Task Analysis</strong> The old lady is an atypical first time user. Users may have difficulties in following the instruction. Illiterate elderly can follow the graphical step-by-step instructions, but elderly have poor sight may need extra help to assist them. The bank should consider additional features, e.g. audio instruction later on. </p></li>
						<li>She inserted the bank notes in wrong direction. The banknote entrance cannot render incoming notes and thus not opened. The old lady is panic. She accidently presses the icon to end the operation and the card comes out. She calles he son for help.
						<p><strong>Task Analysis</strong> This step also showed that she has no knowledge to use the machine. As the machine does not give her any feedback, she does not know how to fix the problem herself.</p></li>
						<li>Her son tells her instruction step by step this time. She put the whole stack of banknotes at once. The machine rejected a 20 note between the inserted bankntoes. The old lady is panic again. Her son told her that machine does not receive 20 notes.
						<p><strong>Task Analysis</strong> It is common that users do not realize things that are not accepted by the machine between the notes.</p><p>User may not realise the reason banknote is rejected. The machine should suggestion solution to fix the problem.</p></li>
						<li>She printed the recipt at the end of operation according to her son instruction. </li>
					</ol>
					<div>
						<strong>Comment on the persona</strong>
						<p>Most elderly are 'ATM phobia' who afraid any ATM machine. The bank should provide demonstration among community, e.g. tv ads, demonstration when they visit branch, to encourage them using the machine. For those who have poor sight, the machine can also provide cs hotline service to assist users.</p>
