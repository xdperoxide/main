					<h2>Purpose</h2>
					<div>Illustrate the situation of Syrian migrants during their journeys. Instead of telling stories in third person point of view, readers have to decide their escape route.

                    <h1>What and why it is good</h1>
                    <h2>#1 Put reader into the same situation with escaping migrant </h2>
                    <p>The interactive report asks readers to choose their gender, journey path and describe the consequence of their choices. They are in the same difficulties as the migrants because they cannot change the previous choices. As a result, the report successfully recreates the state of mind of the escaping migrants on the reader. Those who are indifferent to the migrant before will be invited to enter the migrant’ state of mind. The report makes recognition easier by telling the story of migrants in first person point of view. Reader’s participation is also important for them to understand emotional change of the migrant during the journey. Reader are actually get involved in the story, such that they are having the same feeling as the migrants. The report dissolves the emotion barrier between the people in the story and the reader.  </p>

					<h2>#2 Show the route progression according to number of choices readers have made</h2>
						<p>The interactive report illustrates the path according to the reader’s choices. The report shows the route progression aside and change to show how many choices readers have made. The path also tells readers whether they have reached the end of the story. Human concentration is limited, such that they can only recall the most recent choice they have made. It is possible they forget the first choice after a few choices later. When they scroll up to recall memory of the forgotten content, the path can still remind them how far they have gone so far. Moreover, readers have no idea on the rest of story until they make a choice. The path indicates the end of the story and tell reader to move on the next section. It assists reader who are not good at reading to follow the long journey when the story continue. </p>

					<h2>#3 Large size maps and illustrations shown between paragraph</h2>
					<p>Illustrations and maps helps reader to step into the migrant’s situation, even if they are not familiar with the background of Syrian civil war. All illustrations are in same width as the main content. Reader are fully concentrating on the images or maps. The illustrations before paragraph prepare reader’s state of mind to follow the ongoing part. Most readers are not familiar with Middle East geography. Showing the cities on the map also helps readers to estimate the distance between different destination, route and means to get there.

					<h2>#4 Convince readers with more true stories</h2>
					<p>After the end of story, the report embedded videos of survivors telling their own stories. Readers are convinced by the report because more evidence are shown in front of them. The report uses videos to bring the survivors in front of readers. This is easier to convince readers than telling the stories indirectly through paragraph.</p>
