                    <div>Website of the second biggest selling newspaper in UK. It is similar to Apple daily in Hong Kong but favours female audience more by reporting entertainment news, i.e news about TV show (TV Showbiz), rumors of celebrities and movie stars etc. It tends to amuse readers with stunning headlines and enlarged disturbing images of reports in focus. </div>

                    <h2>#1 Overcrowding homepage</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>The overcrowded homepage confuses visitors as too much information present in front of visitors. Most of items are redundant as most visitors only go through a few items with in larger grid, images included and headlines in larger font size. Visitors may actually go through only the first few items, then move to category they are interested in. The rest of news after the first few focused news (in larger size grid) are organized in grid layout, just looks like how it is printed on newspaper. Each grid consists of a headlines, followed by short summary with or without images. Most of the headline are unnecessary long, which wastes visitor’s time on processing the meaning after scanning the whole sentence. The long summary after the headline is annoying because they are too long to digest. Visitors attracted by the headline can go to detail page when they click title as hyperlink. The homepage uses different color to distinguish between headline (blue) and summary (grey/black). When user can learn the detail by clicking the headline, it is not necessary to attach such a long summary after the headline. Moreover the blue color has no effect of exaggeration when too many items shown at the same time. Headlines in the same font size as summary actually indistinguishable when they come together. They appear as redundant as the summary of the news items in small grid.</p>
                        <strong>Suggest Improvement: </strong>
                        <p>display 1-2 news of each category only at the homepage group by category. The category name as separator should be in distinguishing style. Use short headlines (less than 30 words) in bold font face. Focused news can attach image under title with a short explanation paragraph (less than 50 words). </p>

Another long list in larger size is placed after the article, just for filling up the blank space. It is just meaningless to break two separated list of rumors as ‘don’t miss’ and ‘more don’t miss’. List of latest news and most read items are below the long rumor list that can be ignored easily comparing to the size of the rumor list. But the latest news is more useful for visitors to navigate to the most updated content at detail page. Displaying news list of other categories distracts visitors attention on the main content.</p>
